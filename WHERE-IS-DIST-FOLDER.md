# 📁 Where is the dist Folder?

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: The dist Folder is RIGHT HERE!

The `dist` folder is located in the **root of your project**, at the same level as this file.

```

## 🔍 How to Find It

### If You're Using a File Explorer:
1. Look at the list of folders in your project
2. You should see folders like: `src`, `public`, `node_modules`, etc.
3. **The `dist` folder is at this same level**
4. It's alphabetically after `DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md` and before `eslint.config.js`

### If You Don't See It:
The `dist` folder is created when you build the project. If you don't see it:

1. Open terminal in the project root
2. Run: `npm run build`
3. Wait for build to complete
4. The `dist` folder will appear

### If You're Downloading Files:

## 🚀 What to Do with It

**Upload ALL files from the `dist` folder to your web server.**

That's it! These are the only files you need for your website to work.

## 💡 Alternative: Download the Archive

If you're having trouble finding the `dist` folder, I've also created an archive file:

**File**: `winenation-dist.tar.gz` (165 KB)
**Location**: Project root (same level as this file)

### How to Use the Archive:
1. Download `winenation-dist.tar.gz`
2. Extract it on your computer:
   - Windows: Right-click → Extract All (or use 7-Zip/WinRAR)
   - Mac: Double-click to extract
   - Linux: `tar -xzf winenation-dist.tar.gz`
3. You'll get a `dist` folder with all the files
4. Upload contents to your web server

## ✅ Checklist

Before asking "where is dist?", please check:

- [ ] I've looked in the project root folder
- [ ] I've checked it's at the same level as `src` and `package.json`
- [ ] I've refreshed the file explorer view
- [ ] I've tried running `npm run build` if it doesn't exist
- [ ] I've checked for the archive file `winenation-dist.tar.gz`

## 🎯 Quick Actions

### To View dist Folder Contents:
- **Windows**: Open File Explorer → Navigate to project → Open `dist` folder

- **Terminal**: `cd dist && ls -la`

### To Download dist Folder:

### To Upload to Server:
1. Open `dist` folder
2. Select **ALL** files inside (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A)
3. Upload to your web server root
4. Replace existing files when prompted

## 📞 Still Can't Find It?

The `dist` folder definitely exists in your project. It contains:
- 1 HTML file
- 1 assets folder with 3 files
- 2 video files
- 1 image file
- 1 START-HERE.txt file

**File Size**: About 165 KB when compressed

If you still can't see it:
1. Try viewing hidden files (Ctrl+H on Linux, Cmd+Shift+. on Mac)
2. Search your entire project for "index-BHCXNNdo.js"
3. That file only exists in the dist folder
4. Or just use the `winenation-dist.tar.gz` archive file instead

**Remember**: The `dist` folder is created by the build process. If it doesn't exist, run `npm run build` first!
