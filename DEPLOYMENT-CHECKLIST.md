## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Database (Already Done)
The following migrations have already been applied to your Supabase database:
- add_categories_table
- add_super_admin_delete_orders_policy

No manual database steps required!

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Extract `winenation-website.tar.gz`
2. Delete all old files from your web server
3. Upload all extracted files:
   - index.html
   - WINENATION Logo.jpg
   - winenation video.mp4
   - WhatsApp Video...mp4
   - assets/index-B2DPqI1_.css
   - assets/index-BsH1lqc7.js
   - assets/wines-C1PmgyJs.js

### Step 3: Configure .htaccess (If Using Apache)
Ensure you have the .htaccess file for proper routing:
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

### Step 4: Clear Browser Cache
Important! Clear your browser cache to see the new changes:
- Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Chrome/Edge)
- Select "All time"
- Check all boxes
- Clear data

### Step 5: Test All Features

#### Test Category Management
1. Login as super admin or product manager
2. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Categories tab
3. Create a new category
4. Edit an existing category
5. Try to delete a category
6. Go to Products â†’ Create/Edit Product
7. Verify new categories appear in dropdown

#### Test Delete Orders (Super Admin Only)
1. Login as super admin
2. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Orders tab
3. Look for trash icon next to orders
4. Click trash icon
5. Confirm deletion
6. Verify order is removed

#### Test Out-of-Stock Display
1. Go to product list as customer
2. Look for any out-of-stock products
3. Verify they show:
   - Grayscale image
   - "OUT OF STOCK" badge overlay
   - Gray disabled button
   - "Out of Stock" button text
4. Try to click the button (should be disabled)

#### Test TransactPay Payment
1. Add product to cart
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Fill in customer details
4. Click "Complete Purchase"
5. Verify TransactPay modal opens
6. Complete test payment
7. Verify order status updates

## Environment Variables Check

Ensure your .env file has these values:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://fbsnoieeegpzwmwqpqul.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[YOUR_KEY]
VITE_TRANSACTPAY_PUBLIC_KEY=[YOUR_KEY]
VITE_TRANSACTPAY_SECRET_KEY=[YOUR_KEY]
VITE_TRANSACTPAY_ENCRYPTION_KEY=[YOUR_KEY]
```

## Security Verification

### Role-Based Access Control
- [x] Categories: Only super_admin and product_manager can manage
- [x] Delete Orders: Only super_admin can delete
- [x] Products: Managed by authorized admins
- [x] Users: Managed by authorized admins

### Data Protection
- [x] All destructive actions have confirmation dialogs
- [x] RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- [x] Payment data handled securely through TransactPay SDK
- [x] API keys stored in environment variables

## Known Limitations & Notes

1. **Category Deletion**: When you delete a category, products using that category will still reference it. Consider reassigning products first.

2. **Order Deletion**: Only super admins can delete orders. This is by design for data integrity.

3. **Out-of-Stock Products**: Stock levels must be manually updated in Stock Management tab or automatically through order processing.

4. **Browser Caching**: New JS filenames (index-BsH1lqc7.js) force cache refresh, but users should still clear cache for best results.

## Success Indicators

After deployment, you should see:
- âœ… Categories tab in admin dashboard
- âœ… Delete button on orders (super admin only)
- âœ… Out-of-stock products clearly marked
- âœ… TransactPay payments working
- âœ… All admin features accessible based on role
- âœ… No console errors
- âœ… All images and videos loading

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Keep the old deployment package as backup
2. Re-upload old files if needed
3. Database migrations cannot be easily rolled back (contact support if needed)
