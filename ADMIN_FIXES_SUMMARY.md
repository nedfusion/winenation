# Admin Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Product Edit Functionality ✅
**Problem**: Edit button was not visible or clickable in product manager

**Solution**:
- Made edit button more visible with:
  - Larger icon size (h-5 w-5 instead of h-4 w-4)
  - Blue color for better distinction from delete button
  - Hover effect with background color (hover:bg-blue-50)
  - Added padding and rounded corners
  - Added tooltip "Edit Product"

**How to Use**:
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Products tab
2. Find the product you want to edit
3. Click the BLUE pencil/edit icon on the right
4. Edit form will open with all product details
5. Make changes and click "Update Product"

### 2. User Count on Dashboard ✅
**Problem**: Dashboard showed only 1 user when there are 3 users (1 super admin + 2 product managers)

**Solution**:
- Added RLS policy to allow admins to view all profiles
- Previously, users could only see their own profile
- Now admins can see all profiles for counting and user management

**Technical Details**:
- Created new policy: "Admins can view all profiles"
- Only users with is_admin = true can see all profiles
- Regular users still only see their own profile (security maintained)

### 3. Button Visibility Improvements ✅
**Changes Made**:
- Edit button: Blue color with hover effect
- Delete button: Red color with hover effect
- Both buttons now have:
  - Padding for larger click area
  - Background color on hover
  - Smooth transitions
  - Tooltips for clarity
