# How to Get Your Deployment Files

## 🎯 SOLUTION: The dist Folder Problem is Fixed!

**Problem**: The `dist` folder was hidden/excluded during export because it's in `.gitignore`

**Solution**: I've created a **permanent `DEPLOYMENT-FILES` folder** that will ALWAYS be included when you export!

---

## ✅ NEW: DEPLOYMENT-FILES Folder

### Location
Look for the **`DEPLOYMENT-FILES`** folder in your project root directory.

This folder is NOT in gitignore, so it will ALWAYS export with your project!

### What's Inside
```
DEPLOYMENT-FILES/
├── index.html (1.5 KB)
├── START-HERE.txt (instructions)
├── assets/
│   ├── index-BHCXNNdo.js (527 KB)
│   ├── index-BC9X9Dao.css (24 KB)

## 📦 THREE Ways to Deploy

### ✅ Option 1: Use DEPLOYMENT-FILES Folder (RECOMMENDED)

**This folder is ALWAYS visible and ALWAYS exports!**

1. **Find the folder**: `DEPLOYMENT-FILES` in project root
2. **Open it**: You'll see all website files
3. **Select ALL files** inside (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A)
4. **Upload to your web server**:
   - Via cPanel File Manager → public_html
   - Via FTP → website root
5. **Clear cache** and test!

**Why this works**: This folder is NOT in gitignore, so it exports every time!

---

### ✅ Option 2: Use the Archive File

**File**: `winenation-website.tar.gz` (166 KB)
**Location**: Project root

1. **Download** the archive file
2. **Extract it**:
   - Windows: Use 7-Zip or WinRAR
   - Mac: `tar -xzf winenation-website.tar.gz`
   - Linux: `tar -xzf winenation-website.tar.gz`
3. **Upload extracted files** to your server
4. **Clear cache** and test!

**Why this works**: Archive files are NOT excluded, so they export!

---

### ✅ Option 3: Use dist Folder (If Visible)

If you can see the `dist` folder:

1. **Open** the dist folder
2. **Select ALL files** inside
3. **Upload** to your server
4. **Clear cache** and test!

**Note**: The dist folder might be hidden/excluded during export because it's in `.gitignore`. That's why we created the DEPLOYMENT-FILES folder!

## 🔍 Finding the DEPLOYMENT-FILES Folder

When you look at your project files, you should see:

```
your-project/
├── .bolt/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
├── src/
├── supabase/
├── DEPLOYMENT-FILES/          ← HERE IT IS! 👈👈👈
├── dist/                       (might be hidden)
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── winenation-website.tar.gz  ← OR USE THIS!
└── ... (other files)
```

## 📋 Why dist Folder Gets Hidden

The `.gitignore` file contains:
```
dist
```

This means:
- ✅ The `dist` folder exists on your local machine
- ❌ But it gets excluded when exporting/downloading the project
- ❌ Git ignores it, so it doesn't appear in exports

### The Solution
I created **`DEPLOYMENT-FILES`** which:
- ✅ Contains the EXACT same files as dist
- ✅ Is NOT in gitignore
- ✅ ALWAYS exports with your project
- ✅ Always visible

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: Can't find DEPLOYMENT-FILES folder
**Solutions**:
1. Look in project root (same level as src/ and package.json)
2. Sort folders alphabetically - it starts with "D"
3. If really missing, use the archive: `winenation-website.tar.gz`
4. Extract the archive to get all files

### Problem 2: DEPLOYMENT-FILES is empty
**This should not happen!** But if it does:
1. Use the archive file instead: `winenation-website.tar.gz`
2. Download and extract it
3. Upload extracted files to server

### Problem 3: Still can't see deployment files
**Use the archive method**:
1. Find: `winenation-website.tar.gz` (166 KB) in project root
2. This file contains ALL your website files
3. Download it
4. Extract on your computer
5. Upload extracted contents to server
