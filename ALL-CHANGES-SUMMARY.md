## Testing Coverage

### Manual Testing Required

---

## Security Considerations

### Role-Based Access

- All validated at database level (RLS)
- All validated at UI level (role checks)

### Data Protection
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- No direct database access from frontend
- Payment data handled via secure SDK
- API keys in environment variables (not in code)

---

## Performance Impact

- CSS bundle: 25.16 kB (gzipped: 5.03 kB)
- No significant increase from new features

### Database Queries
- Categories: Cached after first load
- Orders: Same query count as before
