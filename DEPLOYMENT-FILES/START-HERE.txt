🎯 "ORDER FIELD REQUIRED" ERROR FIXED!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Previous Error:
  ❌ "The Order field is required"

Root Cause:
  TransactPay expects structured payload with:
  • customer object (firstname, lastname, email, phone, country)
  • order object (amount, reference, description, currency)
  • payment object (RedirectUrl)

Previous payload was flat (amount, email, reference, etc.)
Now using correct nested structure!

Solution Applied:
  ✅ Restructured payload per TransactPay API docs
  ✅ Added customer object with all required fields
  ✅ Added order object with all required fields
  ✅ Added payment object with RedirectUrl
  ✅ Edge function updated with new structure
  ✅ Frontend passes customer name and phone

🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Error: "The Order field is required"

Previous Payload Structure (WRONG):
{
  "amount": 10000,
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "reference": "WN-123456",
  "currency": "NGN",
  "callback_url": "..."
}

New Payload Structure (CORRECT):
{
  "customer": {
    "firstname": "John",
    "lastname": "Doe",
    "mobile": "+2348012345678",
    "country": "NG",
    "email": "customer@example.com"
  },
  "order": {
    "amount": 10000,
    "reference": "WN-123456",
    "description": "Payment for order",
    "currency": "NGN"
  },
  "payment": {
    "RedirectUrl": "https://yoursite.com/payment/callback"
  }
}

Changes Made:
  1. ✓ Grouped customer info in "customer" object
  2. ✓ Grouped order info in "order" object
  3. ✓ Added "payment" object with RedirectUrl
  4. ✓ Split customer name into firstname/lastname
  5. ✓ Added mobile phone number
  6. ✓ Added country field
  7. ✓ Updated edge function (transactpay-init)
  8. ✓ Updated frontend (transactpay.ts)


📊 TRANSACTPAY PAYLOAD DETAILS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Customer Object (Required):
  • firstname: Customer's first name
  • lastname: Customer's last name
  • mobile: Phone number (format: +234...)
  • country: Country code ("NG" for Nigeria)
  • email: Customer's email address

Order Object (Required):
  • amount: Payment amount (numeric)
  • reference: Unique order reference
  • description: Payment description
  • currency: Currency code (e.g., "NGN")

Payment Object (Required):
  • RedirectUrl: URL to redirect after payment

All three objects are now included in the encrypted payload!


🔒 ENCRYPTION STILL VERIFIED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Encryption Method: PKCS#1 v1.5 (unchanged)
  ✅ Still compliant with TransactPay docs
  ✅ RSA encryption with proper padding
  ✅ Base64 encoded output
  ✅ TransactPay can decrypt

What Changed:
  Only the PAYLOAD STRUCTURE changed
  Encryption method remains the same (PKCS#1 v1.5)

Before Encryption:
  Old: Flat JSON object
  New: Nested JSON with customer/order/payment

After Encryption:
  Same: Base64 encoded RSA-encrypted string


💳 COMPLETE PAYMENT FLOW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. User Fills Checkout Form
   → Shipping address (required!)
   → Phone number (required!)
   → Selects TransactPay

2. Frontend Collects Data
   → Gets customer name from profile
   → Gets phone from checkout form
   → Gets email from user profile
   → Creates payment data object

3. Frontend Calls Edge Function
   → Passes all data to transactpay-init
   → Includes: amount, email, reference, currency
   → Includes: customer_name, phone
   → Includes: callback_url, metadata

4. Edge Function Processes
   → Splits name into firstname/lastname
   → Creates customer object
   → Creates order object
   → Creates payment object
   → Encrypts payload with PKCS#1 v1.5

5. Edge Function Calls TransactPay
   → POST /payment/order/create
   → Header: api-key
   → Body: {"data": "encrypted_base64"}

6. TransactPay Responds
   → Decrypts payload successfully ✓
   → Validates all required fields ✓
   → Returns payment URL

7. User Completes Payment
   → Redirects to TransactPay page
   → Enters payment details
   → Completes transaction
   → Returns to your site


📝 EDGE FUNCTION UPDATES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

File: supabase/functions/transactpay-init/index.ts

Changes:
  1. Added customer_name and phone parameters
  2. Split customer_name into firstname/lastname
  3. Created structured payload:
     • customer object
     • order object
     • payment object
  4. Maintained PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption
  5. Same API endpoint and authentication

Before:
  const payloadData = {
    amount,
    email,
    reference,
    ...
  };

After:
  const payloadData = {
    customer: {
      firstname: ...,
      lastname: ...,
      mobile: phone,
      country: "NG",
      email: email
    },

      amount: amount,
      reference: reference,
      description: ...,
      currency: "NGN"
    },
    payment: {
      RedirectUrl: callback_url
    }
  };

    encryption_key: "...",
    amount: 10000,
    email: "...",
    reference: "WN-...",
    currency: "NGN",
    callback_url: "...",
    metadata: {...},
