🎥 VIDEO TROUBLESHOOTING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If video doesn't play after uploading:

1. VERIFY FILE SIZE ON SERVER:
   After upload, check server file manager:
   ✓ winenation video.mp4 should be 4.3 MB (4,314,623 bytes)
   ✓ If it shows 20 bytes or different size, re-upload!

2. CHECK FILE TYPE:
   Video should be MP4 format
   Some servers show file type - verify it says "MP4" or "video"

3. CLEAR BROWSER CACHE:
   This is THE MOST COMMON ISSUE!
   • Close all browser windows
   • Clear ALL cache and cookies
   • Restart browser
   • Hard refresh 15-20 times (Ctrl+Shift+R)

4. CHECK BROWSER CONSOLE:
   • Press F12 to open developer tools
   • Go to "Console" tab
   • Look for any video errors
   • Check "Network" tab for failed video load

5. TEST IN DIFFERENT BROWSER:
   • Try Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
   • Incognito/Private mode (no cache)
   • This helps identify cache issues

6. CHECK VIDEO PATH:
   Video is referenced as: /winenation video.mp4
   ✓ Must be in website ROOT directory
   ✓ NOT in a subfolder
   ✓ Same level as index.html

7. SERVER PERMISSIONS:
   • Video file needs read permissions (644 or 755)
   • Check with hosting provider if needed

8. BROWSER AUTOPLAY POLICY:
   • Video has muted + autoplay + loop attributes
   • Should work in all modern browsers
   • If blocked, user can click to play


🖼️ LOGO TROUBLESHOOTING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If logo doesn't show:

1. VERIFY FILE SIZE:
   ✓ WINENATION Logo.jpg should be 26 KB (25,674 bytes)
   ✓ NOT 20 bytes!

2. CHECK FILE LOCATION:
   ✓ Must be in website root directory
   ✓ Same folder as index.html
   ✓ Exact name: "WINENATION Logo.jpg" (with space)

3. CLEAR CACHE:
   • Most common issue!
   • Clear ALL browser cache
   • Hard refresh multiple times

4. CHECK BROWSER CONSOLE:
   • Press F12
   • Look for 404 errors on logo file
   • Verify path: /WINENATION%20Logo.jpg
