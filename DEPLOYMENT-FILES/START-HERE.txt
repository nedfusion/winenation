🔧 LATEST FIXES (Build: Oct 18, 2025 19:24 UTC)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CRITICAL FIX: Logo and Video Not Loading

  Problem:
    - Logo not appearing in header
    - Background video not playing on homepage
    - Media files were placeholder files (20 bytes)

  Cause:
    - Binary files weren't being included in build
    - Vite wasn't copying public folder properly

  Solution:
    ✓ Loaded actual binary files (logo 26KB, videos 4.2MB)
    ✓ Configured Vite to copy public directory
    ✓ Verified all media files in deployment package
    ✓ Logo now displays correctly (26KB JPEG)
    ✓ Video now plays correctly (4.2MB MP4)

  Files Verified:
    ✓ WINENATION Logo.jpg: 26 KB (real image file)
    ✓ winenation video.mp4: 4.2 MB (real video file)
    ✓ Both files working and ready to deploy


🧪 HOW TO TEST MEDIA FILES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

After uploading:

1. Visit your website homepage

2. Check LOGO in header:
   ✓ Should see WineNation logo at top left
   ✓ Logo should be clear and visible
   ✓ Size: approximately 48px height

3. Check BACKGROUND VIDEO:
   ✓ Hero section should show video playing
   ✓ Video should autoplay and loop
   ✓ Video should be smooth, not laggy

4. If media doesn't load:
   → Open browser console (F12)
   → Check Network tab
   → Look for 404 errors on media files
   → Verify files uploaded to correct location


📊 FILE SIZES - VERIFY AFTER UPLOAD
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

These are the CORRECT file sizes. After uploading, verify:

JavaScript & CSS:
  ✓ assets/index-CLmWLKds.js → 529 KB
  ✓ assets/index-BC9X9Dao.css → 24 KB
  ✓ assets/wines-C1PmgyJs.js → 6 KB

Media Files (IMPORTANT):
  ✓ WINENATION Logo.jpg → 26 KB (not 20 bytes!)
  ✓ winenation video.mp4 → 4.2 MB (not 20 bytes!)
  ✓ WhatsApp Video... .mp4 → 4.2 MB

If your uploaded files show different sizes (especially 20 bytes),
you may have uploaded placeholder files. Re-download and upload again.
