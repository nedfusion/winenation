🔧 LATEST FIXES (Build: index-CLmWLKds.js)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CRITICAL FIX: TransactPay Payment Processing

  Problem: "Failed to fetch" error during checkout
  Cause: CORS (Cross-Origin) issues when calling TransactPay API
         directly from the browser

  Solution: Created secure edge function that:
    ✓ Runs on Supabase servers (no CORS issues)
    ✓ Securely handles API credentials
    ✓ Proxies requests to TransactPay
    ✓ Provides better error handling
    ✓ Adds comprehensive logging

  How it works:
    1. Customer clicks "Pay with Transactpay"
    2. App calls edge function (on your server)
    3. Edge function calls TransactPay API
    4. Returns payment URL to customer
    5. Customer completes payment

  Benefits:
    ✓ No more CORS errors
    ✓ Secure credential handling
    ✓ Better error messages
    ✓ Detailed console logging
    ✓ Production-ready


🧪 HOW TO TEST PAYMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

After uploading:

1. Visit your website and add products to cart

2. Click checkout

3. Fill in shipping details and phone number

4. Select "Transactpay" as payment method

5. Click "Pay with Transactpay"

6. OPEN BROWSER CONSOLE (F12) to see detailed logs:
   ✓ "Starting TransactPay payment process..."
   ✓ "Generated reference: WN-xxxxx-xxxxx"
   ✓ "Creating order..."
   ✓ "Order created: xxxxx"
   ✓ "Initializing TransactPay payment..."
   ✓ "TransactPay: Response: {...}"
   ✓ "Redirecting to payment page..."

7. Should redirect to TransactPay payment page

8. Complete payment with test card:
   Card: 5060990580000217499
   Expiry: 03/50
   CVV: 564
   PIN: 1111
