🎯 WHAT'S NEW - ENHANCED DEBUG MODE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Previous Error:
  "Payment created but no payment URL received. Please contact support."

Root Cause:
  TransactPay response contains payment URL
  But we don't know which field name they use

New Features:
  ✅ Enhanced logging shows ENTIRE response
  ✅ Shows all available field names
  ✅ Shows complete data structure as JSON
  ✅ Automatically scans ALL fields for HTTP URLs
  ✅ If ANY field contains http:// or https://, uses it!

What You'll See in Console:
  ========== TRANSACTPAY RESPONSE DEBUG ==========
  Full result: {entire JSON response}
  Result status: "success"
  Result data: {data object}
  Data type: "object"
  Available fields in data: ["field1", "field2", ...]
  Data stringified: {formatted JSON}
  ================================================

Then Either:
  ✅ Found URL in field "fieldname": https://...
  ✅ Found payment URL: https://...
  ✅ Redirecting to payment page...

Or:
  ❌ No payment URL found in response
  Available fields: [list of all fields]
  → SHARE THIS OUTPUT WITH ME!


📦 UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: Delete Old Files
-------------------------
Delete these old JavaScript files if present:
  ❌ assets/index-CKASGrub.js
  ❌ assets/index-BJOwXAIE.js
  ❌ assets/index-BA5KQLKS.js

Keep only the NEW file:
  ✅ assets/index-DaFvXvHu.js

STEP 2: Upload New Files
-------------------------
Upload to root directory:
  ☑️ index.html
  ☑️ WINENATION Logo.jpg
  ☑️ winenation video.mp4
  ☑️ WhatsApp Video...mp4

Upload to assets/ folder:
  ☑️ index-DaFvXvHu.js (NEW!)
  ☑️ index-BC9X9Dao.css
  ☑️ wines-C1PmgyJs.js

STEP 3: Clear Cache
--------------------
  1. Ctrl+Shift+Delete (all time)
  2. Clear everything
  3. Close browser
  4. Reopen
  5. Hard refresh 50+ times

STEP 4: Test with Console OPEN
-------------------------------
CRITICAL: Console must be open BEFORE testing!
  1. Press F12 BEFORE going to website
  2. Click Console tab
  3. Keep it visible
  4. Now browse website
  5. Proceed to checkout
  6. Fill shipping + phone (REQUIRED!)
  7. Select Transactpay
  8. Click "Pay with Transactpay"
  9. WATCH the console output!


🧪 WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN CONSOLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You'll see a big debug block:
  ========== TRANSACTPAY RESPONSE DEBUG ==========
  Full result: {
    "status": "success",
    "statusCode": "01",
    "message": "Created order successfully",
    "data": {
      ...all the fields...
    }
  }

Key Information to Look For:
  1. "Available fields in data:" - Shows field names
  2. "Data stringified:" - Shows values
  3. Look for ANY field that contains "https://"

If Payment Works:
  ✅ You'll see: "Found URL in field..."
  ✅ Browser will redirect to TransactPay

If Payment Fails:
  ❌ You'll see: "No payment URL found"
  ❌ Take screenshot of ENTIRE console
  ❌ Share the console output with me
  ❌ I need to see the "Available fields" and "Data stringified"


🔍 AUTO URL DETECTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The code now automatically scans ALL fields in the response.

If ANY field contains a URL (starts with http:// or https://), it will:
  1. Log: "Found URL in field 'fieldname': https://..."
  2. Use that URL for redirect
  3. Open TransactPay payment page

This means it doesn't matter what TransactPay names the field!
  • Could be "payment_url"
  • Could be "authUrl"
  • Could be "checkoutLink"
  • Could be anything!

As long as the value is a URL, we'll find it!


💡 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Scenario 1: Payment Still Doesn't Work
---------------------------------------
Action Required:
  1. Open console (F12) BEFORE testing
  2. Try payment
  3. Look for the debug block in console
  4. Find "Data stringified:" section
  5. Copy the ENTIRE console output
  6. Share with me - I need to see:
     • The full JSON response
     • All available field names
     • All field values

This will tell me EXACTLY what TransactPay returns!

Scenario 2: No Debug Output in Console
---------------------------------------
Possible Causes:
  • Using old JavaScript file
  • Cache not cleared
  • Wrong file uploaded

Solution:
  1. Verify index-DaFvXvHu.js is in assets folder
  2. Check file size is ~530 KB
  3. Delete any old index-*.js files
  4. Clear cache COMPLETELY
  5. Hard refresh 50+ times
  6. Try again

Scenario 3: Console Shows "Available fields: []"
-------------------------------------------------
This means result.data is empty!

Possible Causes:
  • API error occurred
  • Response structure different
  • Look for error messages above

Action:
  • Screenshot the ENTIRE console
  • Share the full response JSON
  • Check for error messages

Scenario 4: URL Found But Not Redirecting
------------------------------------------
Check:
  • Browser popup blocker
  • Browser security settings
  • Console for JavaScript errors
