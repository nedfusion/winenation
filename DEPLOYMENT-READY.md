## ⚠️ Critical Notes

### Cache Clearing is ESSENTIAL
The #1 reason for issues after deployment is browser cache. You **MUST**:
1. Clear ALL cache and cookies
2. Select "All time" or "Everything"
3. Close browser completely
4. Reopen browser
5. Hard refresh 15-20 times (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### File Size Verification
After uploading, check these file sizes on your server:

**CRITICAL FILES:**
- `WINENATION Logo.jpg` → Must be **26 KB** (not 20 bytes!)
- `winenation video.mp4` → Must be **4.3 MB** (not 20 bytes!)
- `assets/index-CLmWLKds.js` → Must be **529 KB**

If any file shows wrong size (especially 20 bytes), re-upload!

### Video Troubleshooting
If video doesn't play:
1. Verify file size is 4.3 MB on server
2. Clear cache completely (most common issue)
3. Try different browser or incognito mode
4. Hard refresh 20+ times
5. Check browser console (F12) for errors
6. Verify file is in root directory (not subfolder)
