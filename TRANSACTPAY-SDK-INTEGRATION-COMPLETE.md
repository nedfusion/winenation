# ‚úÖ TRANSACTPAY SDK INTEGRATION - COMPLETE REWRITE

## What Changed

I **COMPLETELY REWROTE** the TransactPay integration based on your friend's sample code!

### OLD APPROACH (Didn't Work)
- ‚ùå Called REST API via edge function
- ‚ùå Tried to get payment URL from API response  
- ‚ùå Complex encryption and API handling
- ‚ùå Needed backend processing

### NEW APPROACH (Correct Way) 
- ‚úÖ Uses TransactPay JavaScript SDK directly
- ‚úÖ SDK handles everything automatically
- ‚úÖ Opens payment modal instantly
- ‚úÖ No payment URL needed!
- ‚úÖ No backend encryption needed!
- ‚úÖ Payment callbacks handled by SDK

## How It Works Now

1. **SDK Loaded**: Added `<script src="https://payment-web-sdk.transactpay.ai/v1/checkout"></script>` to index.html

2. **Simple Integration**: 
   ```javascript
   const Checkout = new window.CheckoutNS.PaymentCheckout({
     firstName: "Customer",
     lastName: "Name", 
     mobile: "+2348000000000",
     email: "customer@email.com",
     amount: 33500, // in kobo
     reference: "WN-123456",
     apiKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
     encryptionKey: "YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY",
     onCompleted: (data) => { /* Payment success */ },
     onClose: () => { /* User cancelled */ },
     onError: (error) => { /* Payment failed */ }
   });
   
   Checkout.init(); // Opens payment modal instantly!
   ```

3. **Instant Modal**: SDK opens payment page automatically - no URL needed!

4. **Result Handling**: 
   - `onCompleted` = Payment successful
   - `onClose` = User cancelled
   - `onError` = Payment failed

## Files Changed

1. **index.html** - Added TransactPay SDK script
2. **src/vite-env.d.ts** - Added TypeScript definitions for SDK
3. **src/lib/transactpay.ts** - Complete rewrite to use SDK
4. **src/components/checkout/CheckoutModal.tsx** - Simplified payment flow

## Edge Functions Status

- ‚úÖ `transactpay-webhook` - Keep (for verification)
- ‚ùå `transactpay-init` - No longer needed (can delete)

The SDK handles payment initialization directly in the browser!

## Deployment Instructions

### STEP 1: UPLOAD NEW FILES

Extract `winenation-website.tar.gz` and upload these files:

```
index.html (UPDATED with SDK script!)
WINENATION Logo.jpg
winenation video.mp4  
WhatsApp Video 2025-09-26 at 18.12.49_1fce8a2e.mp4
assets/index-CF-4jaQh.js (NEW FILENAME!)
assets/index-BC9X9Dao.css
assets/wines-C1PmgyJs.js
```

**CRITICAL**: The JS filename changed to `index-CF-4jaQh.js` - this forces fresh download!

### STEP 2: CLEAR CACHE (MANDATORY!)

**Option A - Nuclear Clear (RECOMMENDED):**
1. Close ALL browser tabs/windows
2. Delete cache manually:
   - Windows: `C:\Users\[YourName]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache`
   - Mac: `~/Library/Caches/Google/Chrome/Default/Cache`
3. Restart computer
4. Open fresh browser

**Option B - Browser Clear:**
1. Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. Select "All time"
3. Check ALL boxes
4. Clear data
5. Restart browser completely

### STEP 3: TEST PAYMENT

1. Go to your website
2. Add item to cart
3. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
4. Fill in customer details
5. Click "Complete Purchase"

**EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:**
- ‚úÖ TransactPay payment modal opens **INSTANTLY**
- ‚úÖ No "loading payment..." wait
- ‚úÖ No "payment URL not found" errors
- ‚úÖ Payment page appears in modal/popup
- ‚úÖ Complete payment ‚Üí Order marked as paid
- ‚úÖ Cancel payment ‚Üí Order saved as pending

### STEP 4: CONSOLE OUTPUT

With F12 console open, you should see:

```
TransactPay SDK: Initializing payment
Amount: 33500 kobo
Reference: WN-1234567890-123456
Payment completed: { status: "successful", ... }
‚úÖ Payment successful!
```

## Why This Works

1. **No API Calls**: SDK talks directly to TransactPay servers
2. **No Caching Issues**: Frontend code runs fresh every time
3. **Standard Integration**: Follows TransactPay's recommended approach
4. **Proven Pattern**: Same as your friend's working sample code

## What to Check

- [ ] New files uploaded (especially new JS file!)
- [ ] Browser cache completely cleared
- [ ] .env file has correct API keys
- [ ] Payment modal opens when clicking "Complete Purchase"
- [ ] No console errors about "CheckoutNS not found"

## Troubleshooting

**"CheckoutNS is not defined"**
- Solution: The SDK script didn't load. Check index.html has the script tag.

**"TransactPay SDK not loaded"**
- Solution: Refresh page, check internet connection, verify script URL.

**Still seeing old errors**
- Solution: Cache not cleared. Do nuclear clear + restart computer.

**Modal doesn't open**
- Solution: Check console for errors, verify API keys in .env

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ Payment modal opens immediately  
‚úÖ No "payment URL" errors  
‚úÖ Can complete test payment  
‚úÖ Order status updates to "paid"  
‚úÖ Clean console output
