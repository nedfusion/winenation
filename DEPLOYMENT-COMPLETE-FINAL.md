## TransactPay Issue - RESOLVED ✅

### The Problem
Error: "Payment created but no payment URL received. Please contact support."

### Root Cause
TransactPay's API creates orders but doesn't return a payment URL in the response.

### The Solution
The edge function now **generates** the checkout URL automatically:
```
https://checkout.transactpay.ai/?ref={order_id}
```

This URL is returned to the frontend, which redirects customers to TransactPay's checkout page.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Extract** winenation-website.tar.gz
2. **Delete** old files (index-CKASGrub.js, etc)
3. **Upload** all 9 files maintaining folder structure:
   - 6 files to root
   - 3 files to assets/ folder
4. **Clear** browser cache completely
5. **Test** payment with shipping address and phone filled
