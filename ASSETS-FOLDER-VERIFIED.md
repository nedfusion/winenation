# ASSETS FOLDER - VERIFIED AND INCLUDED!

## Status: FIXED ✅

The assets folder is now properly included in the deployment package!

## The Problem
Previous packages were missing the assets folder, causing the site not to load.

## The Solution
- Explicitly created the assets folder using `mkdir -p`
- Copied files individually with verification
- Tested extraction to confirm folder structure
- Verified assets folder exists in tar.gz
