# 📦 Download and Deploy Guide

## ✅ Your Build is Ready!

The `dist` folder contains all the files you need to deploy your website with the admin dashboard fixes.

## 📁 Where to Find the Files

### Option 1: Download the dist Folder Directly

The `dist` folder is located in your project root:

```
your-project/
├── dist/                    ← THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── index-Zqm7-61A.js
│   │   ├── index-q_Eot4Z7.css
│   │   └── wines-C1PmgyJs.js
│   ├── WINENATION Logo.jpg
│   └── winenation video.mp4
├── src/
├── package.json
└── ... (other project files)
```

### Option 2: Download the Archive File

I've created a compressed file for you:
- **File**: `winenation-dist.tar.gz` (166 KB)
- **Location**: Project root folder

**To extract**:
- On Mac/Linux: Right-click → "Extract" or use terminal: `tar -xzf winenation-dist.tar.gz`
- On Windows: Use 7-Zip, WinRAR, or built-in extraction

## 🚀 How to Export/Download from Here

Since you're working in this environment, here's how to get your files:

### Method 1: Download Individual Files
1. Navigate to the `dist` folder in the file explorer
2. Download each file individually:
   - `index.html`
   - Download the entire `assets` folder
   - Download images/videos

### Method 2: Use the Archive
1. Download `winenation-dist.tar.gz` from the project root
2. Extract it on your computer
3. You'll get the `dist` folder with all files

### Method 3: Export Project
1. Export the entire project
2. On your computer, navigate to the `dist` folder
3. That folder contains everything you need

## 📤 Upload to Your Server

Once you have the `dist` folder on your computer:

### Via cPanel File Manager
1. Login to cPanel
2. Click "File Manager"
3. Navigate to `public_html` (or your website root)
4. Click "Upload" button
5. Select ALL files from your `dist` folder
6. Wait for upload to complete
7. If files exist, choose "Overwrite"

### Via FTP
1. Open FileZilla (or your FTP client)
2. Connect to your server
3. Navigate to your website root folder
4. Drag and drop all files from `dist` folder
5. Overwrite existing files when asked

### Via Command Line (SSH)
```bash
# Upload the tar.gz file first
scp winenation-dist.tar.gz user@yourserver.com:/path/to/website/

# SSH into your server
ssh user@yourserver.com

# Extract
cd /path/to/website/
tar -xzf winenation-dist.tar.gz

# Move files to root
mv dist/* .
rm -rf dist
```

## 🗂️ File Structure on Server

After upload, your server should have:

```
/public_html/ (or your website root)
├── index.html                    ← Main file
├── .htaccess                     ← Keep if exists
├── assets/
│   ├── index-Zqm7-61A.js        ← NEW JavaScript
│   ├── index-q_Eot4Z7.css       ← NEW CSS
│   └── wines-C1PmgyJs.js
├── WINENATION Logo.jpg
└── winenation video.mp4
```

## ✅ Verify Upload

Check these URLs directly:

1. `https://yoursite.com/index.html`
   - Should load your website

2. `https://yoursite.com/assets/index-Zqm7-61A.js`
   - Should download a JavaScript file (539 KB)
   - View source of index.html, it should reference this file

3. `https://yoursite.com/assets/index-q_Eot4Z7.css`
   - Should download a CSS file (24 KB)

## 🧹 Clear Cache (CRITICAL!)

After uploading:

### Your Browser
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
2. Select "All time"
3. Check "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear data"

### Hard Refresh (5 times!)
- Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Test in Incognito
- Open Incognito/Private window
- Go to your site
- If it works there, it's a cache issue

## �� Test the Changes

1. Go to `https://yoursite.com/admin/login`

2. Login with:
   - Email: `felixadaeze51@gmail.com`
   - Password: `Mypass.200@@`

3. You should see:
   ```
   Admin Dashboard              [Product Manager] [Back to Store] [🔴 Logout]
   Manage your WineNation store
   Logged in as: felixadaeze51@gmail.com
   ```

4. Click the RED **Logout** button
   - Should redirect to home page
   - Should be logged out

## 🎯 What's Fixed

- ✅ Admin login no longer freezes
- ✅ Logout button is visible (RED, top-right)
- ✅ "Back to Store" button added
- ✅ User email displayed
- ✅ Role badge shown
- ✅ Works on mobile

## 🆘 Still Can't See the dist Folder?

### If Using VS Code or Editor:
1. Click "Refresh" in file explorer
2. The `dist` folder should appear at project root level
3. It's next to `src`, `node_modules`, etc.

### If Using Terminal:
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /tmp/cc-agent/57334882/project

# List files (dist should be there)
ls -la

# See what's in dist
ls -la dist/
```

### If dist Doesn't Exist:
Run this command to rebuild:
```bash
npm run build
```

The `dist` folder will be created with all files.
