## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### STEP 1: Upload Files
1. Download the entire "dist" folder from this project

3. Replace existing files when prompted
4. Verify these files are uploaded:
   - index.html
   - assets/index-Zqm7-61A.js (NEW)
   - assets/index-q_Eot4Z7.css (NEW)

### STEP 2: Clear Browser Cache (CRITICAL!)
