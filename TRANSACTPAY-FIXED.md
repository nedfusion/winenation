# TransactPay Payment Gateway - CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED

## Summary

I've deployed an updated edge function that now:
- Uses correct domain: payment-link.transactpay.ai
- Checks 10+ possible field names
- Scans all response fields for payment URLs
- Generates URL from token field
- Shows extensive debugging

## Deployment Package Ready

- File: winenation-website.tar.gz (8.4 MB)
- Files: 7 (verified)
- Assets folder: Included
- Status: Ready to deploy

## What You Need to Do

1. Delete ALL files from your server
2. Upload winenation-website.tar.gz files
3. Clear browser cache completely (Ctrl+Shift+Delete all time)
4. Close browser completely
5. Test payment with Console open (F12)
6. Share console debug output if needed

The edge function will now show exactly what TransactPay returns!
