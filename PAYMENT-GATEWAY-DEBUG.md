# TransactPay Payment Gateway - Debugging Update

## Issue Identified
The payment gateway was successfully creating payments BUT not returning a payment URL to redirect users to.

Console showed:
```
No payment URL found in response
Data object: Object
Available fields: Array(12)
```

## What I Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Edge Function Debugging
Updated `supabase/functions/transactpay-init/index.ts` to:
- Log the complete response structure from TransactPay API
- Show all available fields in the response
- Try multiple possible field names for the payment reference/ID
- Generate checkout URL from multiple possible sources

### 2. New Debugging Output
The edge function will now show in the console:
```
========== RESPONSE STRUCTURE DEBUG ==========
Full result keys: [...]
result.data keys: [...]
result.data full: {...}
==============================================
```

### 3. Multiple Fallback Strategies
The function now tries to find payment URL or generate it from:
1. `result.data.payment.checkoutUrl`
2. `result.data.id` → generates `https://checkout.transactpay.ai/?ref={id}`
3. `result.data.orderReference` → generates checkout URL
4. `result.id` → generates checkout URL
5. `result.orderReference` → generates checkout URL

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Deploy Updated Files
1. Delete ALL files from your server
2. Extract `winenation-website.tar.gz`
3. Upload all 7 files (including assets folder with 3 files)

### Step 2: Test Payment Again
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Visit your website
3. Add item to cart
4. Fill checkout form (name, email, shipping, phone - ALL REQUIRED)
5. Select TransactPay
6. Click "Pay with Transactpay"
7. **Keep browser console open (F12)** to see the debug output

### Step 3: Share Debug Output
When you test, the console will show detailed information about what TransactPay is returning. Look for:

```
========== RESPONSE STRUCTURE DEBUG ==========
Full result keys: [...]
result.data keys: [list of field names here]
result.data full: {complete object}
==============================================
```

**Share this entire section with me** and I'll be able to see exactly:
- What fields TransactPay returns
- Where the payment ID or reference is located
- How to extract the correct URL

## Expected Outcome

One of these will happen:

### Success
- Console shows: "Generated checkout URL from result.data.id: https://checkout.transactpay.ai/?ref=..."
- Browser redirects to TransactPay checkout page
- Payment works!

### Need More Info
- Console shows: "Could not find ID or reference in response"
- Console shows: "Available fields: [list]"
- Console shows: "Available data fields: [list]"
- **Share this output with me** and I'll update the code to handle TransactPay's actual response format

## Why This Will Help

The previous code was guessing where the payment URL or ID would be. Now we're:
1. Logging exactly what TransactPay sends back
2. Trying multiple possible locations for the ID
3. Generating the checkout URL if we find any kind of reference

Once you test and share the console output, I'll know the exact field names TransactPay uses and can fix it permanently.

## Files Updated

1. **Edge Function**: `supabase/functions/transactpay-init/index.ts`
   - Status: ✅ Deployed
   - Purpose: Better debugging and multiple fallback strategies

2. **Frontend**: No changes needed
   - Already checking all possible URL field names
   - Will work once edge function returns correct URL

3. **Deployment Package**: `winenation-website.tar.gz`
   - Size: 8.4 MB
   - Files: 7 (verified)
   - Assets folder: ✅ Included
   - Status: ✅ Ready

## TransactPay API Details

Endpoint: `https://payment-api-service.transactpay.ai/payment/order/create`
Method: POST
Encryption: PKCS#1 v1.5 RSA ✅
Headers: api-key, Content-Type, Accept ✅
Body: Encrypted payload ✅

Expected Checkout URL format: `https://checkout.transactpay.ai/?ref={order_id}`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Edge function deployed with debugging
2. ✅ Deployment package ready
3. ⏳ **YOU**: Deploy files to server
4. ⏳ **YOU**: Test payment with console open
5. ⏳ **YOU**: Share debug console output

**The key is the console output when you test payment!**
That will tell us exactly what TransactPay returns and where to find the payment ID.
